# Face Recognition Front-end
This is part of the final project for [Andrei's](https://github.com/aneagoie) complete web developer course on Udemy.

To achieve facial recognition of an image this app uses a free API provided by [Clarifai](https://www.clarifai.com/).

Back-end app repository can be found [here](https://github.com/j-ovalle/face-recognition-back-end).
